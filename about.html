        what most often dictates your behavior is the emotion you feel in the moment. <br><br>

        In looking back on an unpleasant or disagreeable experience, the thought
        inevitably occurs to you: if only I had said or done x instead of y, if only I could do it over.<br><br>

        You need someone who can help you reduce the impact of those thoughts on your daily life,
        so you could focus more on the present moment, and see your past as a learning experience.</p>

    <p id="sub" style="text-align: left;">

    We are all humans, and sometimes life will throw some unfortunate events at us,
    and we are still going to make some mistakes along the way. What best equips
    you to cope with these difficult situations is neither more knowledge nor more intellect. <br><br>

What makes your mind stronger, and more able to control your emotions,
 is internal discipline and toughness, and my book, "My walk with God" will guide you through out this process.

             <p id="follow" style="text-align: left;">In my years of teaching, I have encountered a wide range of personalities, leading me to recognise that people are different. They have different problems, different families, and cultures, and therefore react differently to circumstances. <br><br>

              Through my constant interaction with them, I developed an ability to see what their strengths are and what makes them unique. I enjoy guiding them to forge their own route in this life, a route that suits their own spirit and rhythms that lead to self discovery. <br><br>

                And this could be you, my book can help you manage your thought patterns, heal, empathise with others
                and motivate/influence them more effectively.
